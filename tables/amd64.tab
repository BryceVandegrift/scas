#### INSTRUCTION
# INS [MNOMIC] [VALUE]
# MNOMIC is any series of case-insenstive characters with support for special
# characters to define additional functionality. MNOMIC may not have whitespace.
# Special Characters:
#  '_': Required whitespace
#  '-': Optional whitespace
#  '%#<bits[s]>': Immediate value (# is a character to use to identify later)
#  '^#<bits[s]>': Immediate value relative to PC (# is a character to use to identify later)
#  '@#<group>': Operand (# is a character to use to identify later)
#  '&': Special - RST value
# 
# VALUE is a value in binary, which may include references to immediate values and operands
# in use above. For example, in the MNOMIC 'hello,-world_%A<16>_@B<a>', the value could be
# '01011 %A 10110 @B'
#
#### OPERAND GROUP
# OPERAND [GROUP NAME] [OPERAND NAME] [VALUE]
# GROUP NAME is the name of the operand group this belongs to. This is used to reference the
# group in a MNOMIC with the @ operator. OPERAND NAME is the name to match, such as A, B, IX,
# etc. VALUE is the value in binary of this operand.
